# Temple-Run-Statistical-Test

About one year into quarantine I was getting restless. I can no longer skrt by on scrolling through social media and playing Candy Crush; I had to download a new game. I settled on playing Temple Run 2. With its nostalgic and familiar controls, I found myself enjoying the game. However, I was not completely satisfied. The reason why I don't play games such as Temple Run 2 is because they are meaningless. In spite of this, I decided to give Temple Run a meaning by conducting a statistical test on which powerup would collect more coins. 

**Null Hypothesis**
the mean of coins collected during the run powerup = mean of coins collected during coin powerup 

**Alternative Hypothesis**
the mean of coins collected during the run powerup > mean of coins collected during coin powerup 

**Constants I took:**
- I played temple run on the same map
- I collected this data over a period of two weeks
- I did not level up my temple run powerups or use a "head start" at the beginning of any of these runs
- I alternated playing with each power up

**Conclusion**
Since the Z statistic is not in the Rejection Region (z >1.96), we fail to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. We cannot conclude that the mean number of coins collected during the run powerup is greater than the mean number of coins collected during the coin powerup.

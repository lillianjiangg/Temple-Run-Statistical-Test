# Temple-Run-Statistical-Test

About one year into quarantine I was getting restless. I can no longer skrt by on scrolling through social media and playing Candy Crush; I had to download a new game. I settled on playing Temple Run 2. With its nostalgic and familiar controls, I found myself enjoying the game. However, I was not completely satisfied. The reason why I don't play games such as Temple Run 2 is because they are meaningless. In spite of this, I decided to give Temple Run a meaning by conducting a statistical test on which powerup would collect more coins.
